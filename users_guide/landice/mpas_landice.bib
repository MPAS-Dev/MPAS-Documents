abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Coupled ice sheet–ocean models capable of simulating moving grounding lines are just becoming available. Such models have abroad range of potential applications in studying the dynamics of marine ice sheets and tidewater glaciers, from process studies to future projections of ice mass loss and sea level rise. The Marine Ice Sheet–Ocean Model Intercomparison Project (MISOMIP) is acommunity effort aimed at designing and coordinating aseries of model intercomparison projects (MIPs) for model evaluation in idealized setups, model verification based on observations, and future projections for key regions of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS).{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} Here we describe computational experiments constituting three interrelated MIPs for marine ice sheet models and regional ocean circulation models incorporating ice shelf cavities. These consist of ice sheet experiments under the Marine Ice Sheet MIP third phase (MISMIP+), ocean experiments under the Ice Shelf-Ocean MIP second phase (ISOMIP+) and coupled ice sheet–ocean experiments under the MISOMIP first phase (MISOMIP1). All three MIPs use ashared domain with idealized bedrock topography and forcing, allowing the coupled simulations (MISOMIP1) to be compared directly to the individual component simulations (MISMIP+ and ISOMIP+). The experiments, which have qualitative similarities to Pine Island Glacier Ice Shelf and the adjacent region of the Amundsen Sea, are designed to explore the effects of changes in ocean conditions, specifically the temperature at depth, on basal melting and ice dynamics. In future work, differences between model results will form the basis for the evaluation of the participating models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Engwirda2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} Author(s) 2017. An algorithm for the generation of non-uniform, locally orthogonal staggered unstructured spheroidal grids is described. This technique is designed to generate very high-quality staggered Voronoi-Delaunay meshes appropriate for general circulation modelling on the sphere, including applications to atmospheric simulation, ocean-modelling and numerical weather prediction. Using a recently developed Frontal-Delaunay refinement technique, a method for the construction of high-quality unstructured spheroidal Delaunay triangulations is introduced. A locally orthogonal polygonal grid, derived from the associated Voronoi diagram, is computed as the staggered dual. It is shown that use of the Frontal-Delaunay refinement technique allows for the generation of very high-quality unstructured triangulations, satisfying a priori bounds on element size and shape. Grid quality is further improved through the application of hill-climbing-type optimisation techniques. Overall, the algorithm is shown to produce grids with very high element quality and smooth grading characteristics, while imposing relatively low computational expense. A selection of uniform and non-uniform spheroidal grids appropriate for high-resolution, multi-scale general circulation modelling are presented. These grids are shown to satisfy the geometric constraints associated with contemporary unstructured C-grid-type finite-volume models, including the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS-O). The use of user-defined mesh-spacing functions to generate smoothly graded, non-uniform grids for multi-resolution-type studies is discussed in detail.},

  abstract	= {A computational analysis of the accuracy of different
		  approximations to the Stokes equations for momentum balance
		  used in ice sheet modeling is performed by solving a
		  particular tractable form of the equations appropriate for
		  small perturbations of the ice surface, describing the
		  uniform flow of ice with a Glen rheology on an infinitely
		  long and broad section. The approximants comprise the
		  shallow ice approximation and various schemes for
		  incorporating longitudinal stresses and, in one case, the
		  horizontal gradient of the horizontal plane shear stresses.
		  The simplifications lead to a vertically one-dimensional
		  numerical problem, whose solution can be computed rapidly.
		  The relaxation rate of perturbations as well as other
		  response descriptors for the stable full system and
		  approximants are compared. Compared with the shallow ice
		  approximation, the inclusion of longitudinal stresses
		  increases accuracy at shorter wavelengths, but accuracy is
		  poor at wavelengths around or less than the ice sheet
		  thickness. Even though analysis shows that the horizontal
		  gradients of the horizontal plane shear stresses are of
		  similar magnitude to longitudinal stress effects,
		  computations show, in agreement with glaciological belief,
		  that longitudinal stress effects are more significant and
		  need to be corrected for first in practice. Two schemes, a
		  multilayer scheme and a one-layer scheme, are particularly
		  good and should be investigated further in cases where
		  perturbations from uniformity are large. Some other
		  apparently plausible approximations introduce nonphysical
		  instabilities. New schemes need to be assessed in the way
		  described in this paper before being used in real ice sheet
		  models.},

  abstract	= {In this paper, we consider a model for the time evolution
		  of three-dimensional marine ice sheets. This model combines
		  the Shallow Ice Approximation (SIA) for the ice
		  deformation, the Shallow Shelf Approximation (SSA) for the
		  basal sliding, and the mass conservation principle. At each
		  time step, we solve a scalar p-Laplace minimization-type
		  problem with obstacle (SIA), a vectorial p-Laplace
		  minimization-type problem (SSA) and a transport equation
		  (mass conservation). The two minimization problems are
		  solved using a truncated nonsmooth Newton multigrid method
		  while the transport equation is solved using a
		  vertex-centred finite volume method. Our approach is
		  combined to an heuristic mesh adaptive refinement procedure
		  to face the large gradients of the solution that are
		  expected between the ice sheet and the ice shelf. As
		  applications, we present some simulations of the Marine Ice
		  Sheet Model Intercomparison Project MISMIP (2D and 3D) and
		  validate our results against an analytic solution (2D) and
		  other participant model results (3D). Further numerical
		  results show that the convergence of our Newton multigrid
		  method is insensitive to local refinements making our
		  overall adaptive strategy fully efficient. {\textcopyright}

abstract = {Large ice sheets, such as those presently covering Greenland and Antarctica, are important in driving changes of global climate and sea level. Yet numerical models developed to predict climate change and ice sheet-driven sea level fluctuations have substantial limitations: Poorly represented physical processes in the ice sheet component likely lead to an underestimation of sea level rise forced by a warming climate.The resultant uncertainty in sea level projections, and the implications for climate policy, have been widely discussed since the publication of the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [IPCC, 2007]. The assessment report notes that current models do not include “the full effects of changes in ice sheet flow, because a basis in published literature is lacking.” The report also notes that the understanding of rapid dynamical changes in ice flow “is too limited to assess their likelihood or provide a best estimate or an upper bound for sea level rise.”},

In this paper, we describe the$\backslash$nimplementation details for using the template-based generic programming$\backslash$napproach for simulation and analysis of partial differential equations$\backslash$n(PDEs). We detail several of the hurdles that we have encountered, and$\backslash$nsome of the software infrastructure developed to overcome them.
