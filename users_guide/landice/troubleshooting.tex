\section{Choice of time step}

{\bf Symptoms:} ``Error in calculating thickness tendency (possibly CFL violation)'' appears in log.0000.err file.
\\ \\
{\bf Possible cause:} Time step is too long.
\\ \\
{\bf Remedy:}  Shorten time step.  
\\ \\
{\bf Discission:}  The time step must be short enough that the CFL criterion is not violated.  Eventually an adaptive time integrator will be added to MPAS-Land Ice.
