\begin{itemize}
\item{The barycentric interpolation used to calculate surface elevation at vertices gives garbage values for vertices associated with obtuse triangles on the dual mesh.  Therefore, the model will only work properly for meshes with no obtuse triangles.  Currently there is no error message when this occurs, so users must be aware of this constraint.  Future work will improve the barycentric interpolation method to work for obtuse triangles. }

\item{Paraview plots periodic fields in a messy way with lines connecting the periodic cells across the domain.}

\item{Paraview gives the following fatal error with some Land Ice output files: "NetCDF: Start+count exceeds dimension bound".}

\item{Paraview will not recognize fields without a vertical dimension (e.g. thickness will not be recognized) in versions earlier than 4.1.}
\end{itemize}
