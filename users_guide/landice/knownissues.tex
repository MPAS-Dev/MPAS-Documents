\begin{itemize}
\item{Plotting of periodic field with Paraview}
\item{Paraview will not recognize fields without a vertical dimension (e.g. thickness will not be recognized).  Current nightly builds of Paraview have fixed this problem and this functionality should be available in the next release.}
\end{itemize}
