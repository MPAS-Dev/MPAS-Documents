\chapter{Model Analysis}
\label{chap:landice-analysis}

As with other climate model components built using the MPAS framework, MALI supports the development and application of ``analysis members", which allow for a wide range of run-time-generated simulation diagnostics and statistics output at user specified time intervals. Support tools included with the code release allow for the definition of any number or combination of pre-defined ``geographic features'' -- points, lines (``transects''), or areas (``regions'') -- of interest within an MPAS mesh. Features are defined using the standard GeoJSON format \citep{geojson} and a large existing database of globally defined features is currently supported\footnote{\url{https://github.com/MPAS-Dev/geometric_features}}. Python-based scripts are available for editing GeoJSON feature files, combining or splitting them, and using them to define their coverage within MPAS mesh files. Currently, MALI includes support for standard ice sheet model diagnostics (see Table \ref{table:analysisVars}) defined over the global domain (by default) and / or over specific ice sheet drainage basins and ice shelves (or their combination). Support for generating model output at points and along transects will be  added in the future (e.g., vertical samples at ice core locations or along ground-penetrating radar profile lines). 
Defining regions requires tools that are not yet publicly available.
