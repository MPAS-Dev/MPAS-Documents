\chapter{Model Configuration}

The chapter covers the dimensions used in the model, the Namelist options which 
are used to provide run-time configurability of model options, and the variables
used in the model.

% Note: the autogenerated sections are generated by MPAS-Tools/python_scripts/namelist_generation/parse_ocean_xml_registry.py
% and then copied into MPAS-Documents/users_guide/landice/autogenerated_docs_from_registry.
% Doug has created an overly complicated version (it handles forward and analysis modes, which we don't have) of this autogen script for the ocean core.
% I have created a branch of it that hacks it for use with the land ice core.  It is in my fork as landice_userguide_autogen_mods.
% Invoke with something like: python parse_ocean_xml_registry.py -f ~/documents/mpas-git/MPAS/src/core_landice/Registry_processed.xml -a ~/documents/mpas-git/MPAS/src/core_landice/Registry_processed.xml -d /Users/mhoffman/documents/mpas-git/MPAS-Documents/users_guide/landice/section_descriptions -p landice/section_descriptions
% Note that it will use the pre-processed version of Registry, not the raw version, so you have to have compiled the code itself.
% Then copy the result to the users guide source directory:
% cp define_version.tex namelist_sections.tex variable_sections.tex ~/documents/mpas-git/MPAS-Documents/users_guide/landice/autogenerated_docs_from_registry/
% and rename the mode_forward version:
% cp mode_forward_sections.tex ~/documents/mpas-git/MPAS-Documents/users_guide/landice/autogenerated_docs_from_registry/registry_sections.tex
