The mesh data type contains a single time level. The fields inside the mesh
structure are not assumed to be time dependent. This data structure contains
fields that describe the mesh, and the connectivity of the mesh. Most of the
fields contained in this structure are shared throughout all MPAS cores.  
Additionally, a few Land Ice specific variables (that are time-independent)
are stored here, but may be moved in the future.
