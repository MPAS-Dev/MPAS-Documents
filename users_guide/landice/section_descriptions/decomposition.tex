MPAS handles decomposing all variables into computational blocks. The
decomposition used needs to be specified at run time and is computed by an
external tool (e.g. metis). Additionally, MPAS supports multiple computational
blocks per MPI process, and the user may specify an additional decomposition
file which can specify the assignment of blocks to MPI processes. Run-time
parameters that control the run-time decomposition used are specified within
the decomposition namelist record.
