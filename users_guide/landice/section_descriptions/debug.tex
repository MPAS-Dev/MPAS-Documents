At run-time a user can enable debugging features within MPAS-Land Ice. 
Currently the only debug option is to print more detailed information about
thickness advection.
Potential future debug options would be to include disabling of any 
tendencies to help determine why an issue might
be happening; various checks on certain fields;
and the ability to prescribe both a thickness and velocity field at run-time
which are constant throughout a simulation. All options that control these
debugging features are specified within the debug namelist record.
