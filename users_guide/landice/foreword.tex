The MPAS-Albany Land Ice (MALI) is an unstructured-mesh land ice model (ice sheets or glaciers) capable of using enhanced 
horizontal resolution in selected regions of the land ice domain.  
This allows researchers to perform high-resolution regional simulations at a lower computational cost, 
while providing realistic ice flow from the low-resolution regions. 
Model domains may be spherical or on Cartesian domains.  
MALI is designed for large-scale, high-resolution simulations of ice sheet dynamics, 
using a combination of Finite Difference, Finite Volume, and Finite Element Methods on variable resolution meshes.  
MALI is currently released with support for standard test cases used in verifying model performance. 
Eventually, support for standard ice sheet configurations will also be included 
(e.g., stand-alone Greenland and Antarctica simulations).
MALI is the ice sheet component in the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) v1.0
(https://climatemodeling.science.energy.gov/projects/energy-exascale-earth-system-model).

MALI shows good agreement with manufactured solutions and standard test cases
and has been used in land ice evolution experiments estimating potential for future sea-level rise from ice sheets 
(e.g., Ice2Sea international assessment project \citep{Shannon2013, edwards2014}).  

MPAS-Land Ice is one component within the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) framework of climate model components
 that is developed in cooperation between Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).  
Functionality that is required by all cores, such as i/o, time management, block decomposition, etc, is developed collaboratively, and this code is shared across cores within the same repository.  
Each core then solves its own differential equations and physical parameterizations within this framework.  
This user's guide reflects the spirit of this collaborative process, where Part I, ``The MPAS Framework'', applies to all cores, 
and the remaining parts apply to MPAS-Albany Land Ice.

MPAS-Albany Land Ice also makes use of the Albany/LI velocity solver (formally Albany/FELIX) for implementation of the first-order
velocity solver.  Not all details of running and configuring that velocity solver are covered in this User's Guide.  
We refer the user to Albany's website for more information about installing and running Albany: https://github.com/gahansen/Albany

MPAS-Albany Land Ice is described by a model description paper currently in review in Geoscientific Model Descriptions at:
https://www.geosci-model-dev-discuss.net/gmd-2018-78/
Much of the information in this User's Guide is derived from the text of that paper.


A history of releases of the Land Ice core within the MPAS version numbering scheme is as follows:

\begin{tabular}{p{1.5cm} p{3.7cm} p{10cm}}

6.0 & April 17, 2018 & Addition of Albany FO velocity solver, thermal solver, subglacial hydrology model, calving, analysis members, coupling to E3SM.\\
\hline 
3.0 & November 18, 2014 & Fix bug in SIA slope calculation.  Introduction of run-time I/O streams. \\
\hline 
2.0 & November 15, 2013 & Initial public release of Land Ice core (SIA velocity solver only) \\
\hline 
\end{tabular}
