@Article{	  skamarock2012,
  abstract	= {The formulation of a fully compressible nonhydrostatic
		  atmospheric model called the Model for Prediction Across
		  Scales–Atmosphere (MPAS-A) is described. The solver is
		  discretized using centroidal Voronoi meshes and a C-grid
		  staggering of the prognostic variables, and it incorporates
		  a split-explicit time-integration technique used in many
		  existing nonhydrostatic meso-and cloud-scale models. MPAS
		  can be applied to the globe, over limited areas of the
		  globe, and on Cartesian planes. The Voronoi meshes are
		  unstructured grids that permit variable horizontal
		  resolution. These meshes allow for applications beyond
		  uniform-resolution NWP and climate prediction, in
		  particular allowing embedded high-resolution regions to be
		  used for regional NWP and regional climate applications.
		  The rationales for aspects of this formulation are
		  discussed, and results from tests for nonhydrostatic flows
		  on Cartesian planes and for large-scale flow on the sphere
		  are presented. The results indicate that the solver is as
		  accurate as existing nonhydrostatic solvers for
		  nonhydrostatic-scale flows, and has accuracy comparable to
		  existing global models using icosahedral (hexagonal) meshes
		  for large-scale flows in idealized tests. Preliminary
		  full-physics forecast results indicate that the solver
		  formulation is robust and that the variable-resolution-mesh
		  solutions are well resolved and exhibit no obvious problems
		  in the mesh-transition zones.},

@Article{	  ringler2013,
  abstract	= {A new global ocean model (MPAS-Ocean) capable of using
		  enhanced resolution in selected regions of the ocean domain
		  is described and evaluated. Three simulations using
		  different grids are presented. The first grid is a uniform
		  high-resolution (15. km) mesh; the second grid has
		  similarly high resolution (15. km) in the North Atlantic
		  (NA), but coarse resolution elsewhere; the third grid is a
		  variable resolution grid like the second but with higher
		  resolution (7.5. km) in the NA. Simulation results are
		  compared to observed sea-surface height (SSH), SSH variance
		  and selected current transports. In general, the
		  simulations produce subtropical and subpolar gyres with
		  peak SSH amplitudes too strong by between 0.25 and 0.40. m.
		  The mesoscale eddy activity within the NA is, in general,
		  well simulated in both structure and amplitude. The uniform
		  high-resolution simulation produces reasonable
		  representations of mesoscale activity throughout the global
		  ocean. Simulations using the second variable-resolution
		  grid are essentially identical to the uniform case within
		  the NA region. The third case with higher NA resolution
		  produces a simulation that agrees somewhat better in the NA
		  with observed SSH, SSH variance and transports than the two
		  15. km simulations. The actual throughput, including I/O,
		  for the x1-15km simulation is the same as the structured
		  grid Parallel Ocean Program ocean model in its standard
		  high-resolution 0.1° configuration. Our overall conclusion
		  is that this ocean model is a viable candidate for
		  multi-resolution simulations of the global ocean system on
		  climate-change time scales. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier

@Article{	  petersen2015,
  abstract	= {The vertical coordinate of the Model for Prediction Across
		  Scales-Ocean (MPAS-Ocean) uses the Arbitrary
		  Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method, which offers a variety of
		  configurations. When fully Eulerian, the vertical
		  coordinate is fixed like a z-level ocean model; when fully
		  Lagrangian there is no vertical transport through the
		  interfaces so that the mesh moves with the fluid;
		  additional options for vertical coordinates exist between
		  these two extremes, including z-star, z-tilde, sigma, and
		  isopycnal coordinates. Here we evaluate spurious diapycnal
		  mixing in MPAS-Ocean in several idealized test cases as
		  well as real-world domains with full bathymetry. Mixing
		  data is compared to several other ocean models, including
		  the Parallel Ocean Program (POP) z-level and z-star
		  formulations. In three-dimensional domains, MPAS-Ocean has
		  lower spurious mixing that other ocean models. A series of
		  simulations show that this is likely due to MPAS-Ocean's
		  hexagon-type horizontal grid cells combined with a
		  flux-corrected transport tracer advection scheme designed
		  for these unstructured meshes.The frequency-filtered
		  vertical coordinate of Leclair and Madec (2011) (also
		  called z-tilde) has been implemented and analyzed in
		  MPAS-Ocean. This addition allows low-frequency vertical
		  transport to pass through the vertical interface in an
		  Eulerian manner, while high-frequency vertical
		  oscillations, such as internal gravity waves, are treated
		  in a Lagrangian manner. Z-tilde leads to a substantial
		  reduction in vertical transport across layer interfaces,
		  and a reduction in spurious diapycnal mixing.},
