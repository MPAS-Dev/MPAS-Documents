\section{Column Physics}
\label{sec:column_physics}

This version of MPAS-Seaice uses an early version of the Icepack library for column physics and biogeochemistry. Full documentation for Icepack can be found at \url{https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/Icepack}. Icepack includes sophisticated vertical physics and biogeochemical schemes, which include vertical thermodynamics schemes \citep{BL99,Turner13,Turner15}, several melt-pond parameterizations \citep{Flocco10,Holland12,Hunke13}, a delta-Eddington radiation scheme \citep{Briegleb07,Holland12}, schemes for transport in thickness space \citep{Lipscomb01}, and representations of mechanical redistribution \citep{Lipscomb07}.
