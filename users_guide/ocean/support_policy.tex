\chapter{Support Policy}
\label{chap:ocean-support}
This chapter will define the current support policy for the MPAS-Ocean team.

Currently, support for MPAS-Ocean is only provided through two mediums. The
first being the issue tracker on the
\href{https://github.com/MPAS-Dev/MPAS-Release/issues?state=open}{MPAS-Release
github site}, and the second being the
\href{https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mpas-users}{MPAS-Ocean user
mailing list}. 

For the time being, MPAS-Ocean developers will only support setups provided
through the release web-site. At present, we do not have enough resources to
provide support for model development exercises, and modified test cases. Users
interested in modifying MPAS-O source code are referred to the MPAS-Developer's
guide on the \href{http://mpas-dev.github.io/}{MPAS website}.

For questions about the variables and namelist options, users are referred to
Chapters  \ref{chap:namelist_sections} and \ref{chap:variable_sections} in this
users guide.

\section{Reporting bugs}
\label{sec:bug-reports}
Bugs can be confirmed through the mailing list, but a bug report should be
made through the issue tracker on the github website.
It is expected that the user provides the information requested
\href{https://gist.github.com/douglasjacobsen/5868321}{in this form} when
reporting a bug.

This enables the developers to more easily try to reproduce the issue and
figure out what the cause is.
