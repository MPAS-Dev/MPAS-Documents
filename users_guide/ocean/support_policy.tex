\chapter{Support Policy}
\label{chap:ocean-support}
Please see the E3SM support policy at
\href{https://e3sm.org/resources/policies/support-policy}{https://e3sm.org/resources/policies/support-policy}, part of which is copied here.

The E3SM project fully realizes and embraces the importance of making the model source code, the data and the application software tools publicly available, and of communicating and informing the scientific community and the public about all stages of the project, its research and future plans.

As the model code becomes an open development project, we cannot commit ourselves to increased support to cover developmental versions. We are committed though to provide limited support for the scientifically validated simulations from which the data will be publicly released.
