\section{Purpose}
\label{sec:forward_purpose}

The forward mode of the ocean core is used to simulate an ocean forward in time. 

\section{Compilation}
\label{sec:forward_compilation}

In order to build the ocean core in forward mode, one must first select a build
target. In this example, we'll build using the gfortran build target. The build
enviroment should be setup as described in Chapter
\ref{chap:mpas_build_instructions}. After the build environment and target are
selected, the forward mode of the ocean core can be built as follows:

\vspace{12pt}
{\tt > make gfortran CORE=ocean MODE=forward}
