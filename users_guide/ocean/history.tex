\chapter*{History}
\label{chap:history}

A history of MPAS-Ocean releases follows.  Each MPAS core does not participate in all releases, which is why some numbers are missing.


\begin{tabular}{ll p{4in}}
\hline\hline version & date & description of new additions  \\
\hline
E3SM 3.0.0 & March 4, 2024 &
MPAS-Ocean was moved from the MPAS-Dev repository via an E3SM submodule to code
directly within the E3SM repository. Many new features and improvements have
been added.
\\
\hline
6.0 & April 18, 2018 &
Ability to couple with E3SM.
New in-situ analysis computations.
Division of tracers into groups to control output, algorithms, and forcing.
Addition of biogeochemistry tracers and column computations.
\\
\hline
3.0 & November 18th, 2014 &
GM mesoscale eddy parameterization, CVMix vertical mixing module (includes KPP), forward/analysis modes, variable pools data structures, and run-time configurable i/o streams \\
\hline
2.0 & November 15th, 2013 &
Surface forcing capabilities, Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian vertical grid for z-level, z-star, z-tilde, sigma, idealized isopycnal \\
\hline
1.0 & June 14th, 2013 & Primitive equation (hydrostatic) ocean model for idealized and realistic global domains using split-explicit time-stepping, flux-corrected transport advection, Jackett-McDougall EOS, harmonic/biharmonic horizontal mixing, and implicit Richardson number-based vertical mixing.  Vertical coordinate may be z-level or z-star with partial bottom cells, or idealized isopycnal. \\
\hline
0.0 & June 14th, 2013 & Initial pre-release of MPAS \\
