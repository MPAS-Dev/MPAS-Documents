A history of MPAS-O releases follows: \\


\begin{tabular}{ll p{4in}} 
\hline\hline version & date & description of new additions  \\
\hline 
3.0 & November 18th, 2014 & 
GM mesoscale eddy parameterization, CVMix vertical mixing module (includes KPP), forward/analysis modes, variable pools data structures, and run-time configurable i/o streams \\
\hline 
2.0 & November 15th, 2013 & 
Surface forcing capabilities, Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian vertical grid for z-level, z-star, z-tilde, sigma, idealized isopycnal \\
\hline 
1.0 & June 14th, 2013 & Primitive equation (hydrostatic) ocean model for idealized and realistic global domains using split-explicit time-stepping, flux-corrected transport advection, Jackett-McDougall EOS, harmonic/biharmonic horizontal mixing, and implicit Richardson number-based vertical mixing.  Vertical coordinate may be z-level or z-star with partial bottom cells, or idealized isopycnal. \\
