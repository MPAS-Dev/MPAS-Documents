\section{Time filter}
\label{sec:timeFilter}

The time filter analysis member can partition a given field into high and low pass 
components via a recursive filter design.  The simplest use case is to directly
calculate the mean and eddy velocities in-situ within a simulation.  

This analysis member implements a simple recursive filtering approach based on an impulse model.
Let $V$ be the velocity signal and $V_L$ the low-pass filtered velocity, corresponding to some 
timescale $\tau$ such that $\tau > \Delta t$, the time step.  Thus, this process can be represented by a simple ODE
for the impulse $I = V-V_L$: 

\begin{equation}
  \frac{dV_L}{dt} = \frac{I}{\tau} = \frac{V-V_L}{\tau},
\end{equation}
where the initial condition is that $V_L(t=t_0) = V(t=t_0)$.  
Discretizing in terms of the current time step level $n$ and previous time step level $n-1$ yields

\begin{equation}
  \frac{V_L^n-V_L^{n-1}}{\Delta t} = \frac{V^n -V_L^n}{\tau},
\end{equation}
with rearrangement yielding
\begin{equation}
  V_L^n = V_L^{n-1}\left(1-\frac{\Delta t}{\tau}\right) + \frac{\Delta t}{\tau} V^n.
  \label{eq:convexCombo}
\end{equation}
In the limit that $\tau \rightarrow \Delta t$, $V_L \rightarrow V$ and for 
$\tau \rightarrow \infty$, $V_L \rightarrow V(t=t_0)$.  Additional filtering techniques 
using $V^{n-1}$ could also be used but are avoided to maintain conceptual
simplicity.
The high-pass filtered value $V_H$ is then given by 
\begin{equation}
  V_H^n = V^n - V_L^n.
  \label{eq:highPass}
\end{equation}

The filter is implemented within the time filter analysis member via Equations (\ref{eq:convexCombo}) and (\ref{eq:highPass}).  $V_L$ terms will be designated via the 
variable prefix \verb+LowPass+ and $V_H$ by \verb+HighPass+.  This requires initialization of the following fields in the analysis member registry: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item normalVelocityLowPass 
  \item normalVelocityHighPass 
\end{itemize}
These fields can then be utilized by other analysis members, e.g., LIGHT for high-performance particle tracking.

The analysis member is easily extensible to any field because the filter is an element-wise operation.
