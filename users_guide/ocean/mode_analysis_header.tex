\section{Purpose}
\label{sec:analysis_purpose}

The analysis mode of the ocean core is used to analyze a ocean NetCDF file.

\section{Compilation}
\label{sec:analysis_compilation}

In order to build the ocean core in analysis mode, one must first select a
build target. In this example, we'll build using the gfortran build target. The
build enviroment should be setup as described in Chapter
\ref{chap:mpas_build_instructions}. After the build environment and target are
selected, the analysis mode of the ocean core can be built as follows:
