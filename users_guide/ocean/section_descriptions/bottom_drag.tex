The bottom drag is applied as a bottom boundary condition within the implicit solve of vertical mixing in the momentum equation (\ref{ocean:momentum}), as
\begin{equation}
\lim_{z\rightarrow z_{bot}} \nu_v \frac{\partial u}{\partial z} = c_{drag} \left|u\right| u,
\end{equation}
where $c_{drag}$ is the dimensionless bottom drag coefficient, and $z_{bot}$ is the $z$-location of the ocean bottom.
