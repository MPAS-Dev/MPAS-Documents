The scratch data type contains a single time level. The scratch structure
contains fields that are used in various parts of the ocean model. All fields
in the scratch structure are defined as scratch variables, meaning they are not
allocated unless explicitly allocated in the source code. Variables defined in
the scratch structure are intended to be used as temporary work arrays.
