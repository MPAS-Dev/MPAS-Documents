The CVMix namelist record is intended to control the Community Vertical Mixing package \url{https://github.com/CVMix}. CVMix is a collection of individual vertical mixing parameterizations intended to model background, convective, shear, tidal, double diffusion and ocean mixed layer processes. The output of each CVMix parameterization is a vertical profile of viscosity/diffusivity for a specific process. The CVMix parameterizations are constructed and implemented as ``stand-alone'' modules, so each parameterization can be toggled on/off without directly impacting the use of other parameterizations. The net viscosity/diffusivity used by the ocean model is the sum of all of the individual viscosity/diffusivity profiles. The one exception to this rule is when KPP is used with matching set to ``MatchBoth''; in this instance the KPP-computed viscosity/diffusivity is the only contribution to mixing from the surface to the bottom of the ocean mixed layer.
