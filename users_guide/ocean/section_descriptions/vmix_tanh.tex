\textbf{NOTE}: This option is defunct and may be depracated in a future release.  Use of this parameterization is not recommended.

Here the vertical viscosity $\nu_v$ and diffusion $\kappa_v$ are produced with a hyperbolic tangent function, which produces more mixing in shallow waters and less in the deep ocean.  It is uniform horizontally and in time.  This option is not reproducible in CVMix.
