In the Richardson-number based vertical mixing parameterization \citep{Pacanowski_Philander81jpo}, the vertical diffusivity and viscosity are functions of the Richardson Number,
\begin{eqnarray}   
\label{ocean:\mode_Ri1}
Ri &=& N^2
\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial z} \right)^{-2}
 = -\frac{g}{\rho_0}\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial z}
\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial z} \right)^{-2},
\end{eqnarray}
where $V=\sqrt{u^2+v^2}=\sqrt{2ke}$ is the velocity magnitude.  The discrete version is
\begin{eqnarray}   
Ri^{top}_k &=& -\frac{g}{\rho_0}\frac{\rho^*_{k-1}-\rho^*_k}{\frac{1}{2}(h_{k-1}+h_k)}
\left(\frac{u_{k-1}-u_k}{\frac{1}{2}(h_{k-1}+h_k)}\right)^{-2}\\
 &=& -\frac{g}{\rho_0}\frac{(\rho^*_{k-1}-\rho^*_k)\frac{1}{2}(h_{k-1}+h_k)}
{(u_{k-1}-u_k)^2+\epsilon}
\end{eqnarray}
where $top$ indicates a layer interface, $ke$ is the cell-centered kinetic energy, $\rho^*_k$ is the density in layer $k$ adiabatically displaced to the surface, and $\epsilon$ is a small number to avoid dividing by zero.  

The variable $Ri^{top}$ must be available at cell edges for the viscoscity $\nu_v$ and at cell centers for the tracer diffusion $\kappa_v$.  In addition, the computation of shear is native to the edges, while density is native to the cell centers.  

The functional forms for vertical viscosity and diffusivity at each layer interface are as follows,
\begin{eqnarray} \label{ocean:\mode_visc1}  
\nu_v &=& \nu_{bkrd} + c_{Ri}/(1+5Ri)^2\\
\kappa_v &=& \kappa_{bkrd} + (\nu_{bkrd} + c_{Ri}/(1+5Ri)^2)/(1+5Ri)
\end{eqnarray}
for $Ri>=0$.  For unstable stratification, $Ri<0$ and the viscosity and diffusion are set to the convective values, which are typically very high.

Note: The functionality of this namelist has been superceded by the CVMix package, which has it's own namelist.  This namelist has been kept for backwards compatibility with and verification against version 2.0.
