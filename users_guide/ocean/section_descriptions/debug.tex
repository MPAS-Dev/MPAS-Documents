At run-time a user can enable debugging features within MPAS-Ocean. These
features include disabling any tendencies to help determine why an issue might
be happening. Debugging options also include various checks on certain fields,
and the ability to prescribe both a thickness and velocity field at run-time
which are constant throughout a simulation. All options that control these
debugging features are specified within the debug namelist record.
