The \cite{Leith:1996wu} closure is the enstrophy-cascade analogy to the \cite{Smagorinsky:1963wc} energy-cascade closure, i.e.  the Leith closure assumes an inertial range of enstrophy flux moving toward the grid scale. The assumption of an enstrophy cascade and dimensional analysis produces right-hand-side dissipation, $\bf{D}$, of velocity of the form

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Leith}
{\bf D} = \nabla \cdot \left( \Gamma \left| \nabla \omega  \right| \left( \Delta x \right)^3 \nabla \bf{u} \right)=\nabla \cdot \left( \nu_\ast \nabla {\bf u} \right)
\end{equation}
where $\omega$ is the relative vorticity, ${\bf u}$ is the horizontal velocity, $\Delta x$ is the local grid spacing and $\Gamma$ is a non-dimensional, $O(1)$ parameter. This beta release approximates the RHS of the \ref{eq:Leith} as

\begin{equation}
\bf{D^u}=\nu_\ast \nabla^2 {\bf u}
\end{equation}
where the $\nabla^2 {\bf u}$ is computed using the form shown in \ref{ocean:h_mom_del4a}. Future releases will remove this approximation by computing the rate-of-strain, i.e. $\nabla {\bf u}$, directly.
