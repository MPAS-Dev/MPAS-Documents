Here the vertical viscosity $\nu_v$ and diffusion $\kappa_v$ are simply constant throughout the domain.  This option is useful for testing and idealized domains but is not appropriate for real-world simulations, as the deep ocean should have much less mixing that the mixed layer.

Note: The functionality of this namelist has been superceded by the CVMix package, which has it's own namelist.  This namelist has been kept for backwards compatibility with and verification against version 2.0.
