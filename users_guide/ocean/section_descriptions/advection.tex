Three-dimensional tracer advection can be computed using 2$^{nd}$, 3$^{rd}$ or 4$^{th}$ flux reconstructions in the horizontal and vertical. In the horizontal, the high-order (i.e. 3$^{rd}$ or 4$^{th}$) flux reconstruction is done following \cite{Skamarock:2011tc}. Typically, the scheme is implemented with an upwind-bias ($\beta$=0.25 in (11) from \cite{Skamarock:2011tc}) to produce a 3$^{rd}$-order accurate reconstruction of tracer flux divergence on uniform hexagonal meshes. In the vertical, high-order estimates of tracer values at layer edges are reconstructed using a cubic spline. Monotone transport is guaranteed by blending these high-order flux approximations with the 1$^{st}$-order, upstream flux using the \cite{Zalesak:1979wm} flux-corrected transport scheme.
