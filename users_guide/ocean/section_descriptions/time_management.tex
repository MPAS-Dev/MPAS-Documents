General time management is handled by the time\_management namelist record.
Included options handle time-related parts of MPAS, such as the calendar and if the simulation is a restart or not.

Users should use this record to specify the beginning time of the simulation,
and either the duration or the end of the simulation. Only the end or the
duration need to be specified as the other is derived within MPAS from the
beginning time and other specified one.

{\bf TBA: If both duration and stop are specified, then what happens?)}
