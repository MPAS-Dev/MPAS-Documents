\subsection{Provided Files}
\label{subsec:realWorld_files}

\begin{itemize}
	\item grid.nc: \\
		This is the input grid file that includes initial conditions.  \\
		It can be visualized in the same way output files can to see the initial conditions.
	\item graph.info: \\
		This file is a graph of all of the cells in the mesh. \\
		It is used to decompose the mesh into partition files.
	\item graph.info.part.2: \\
		This is a partition file for use with a 2 processor run. \\
		The graph.info file has been decomposed into two blocks for this file.
	\item graph.info.part.4: \\
		This is a partition file for use with a 4 processor run. \\
		The graph.info file has been decomposed into four blocks for this file.
	\item graph.info.part.8: \\
		This is a partition file for use with a 8 processor run. \\
		The graph.info file has been decomposed into eight blocks for this file.
	\item namelist.input: \\
		This is the namelist file with all parameters for the run. \\
		It has a default setup which when run provides the results in the next section.
