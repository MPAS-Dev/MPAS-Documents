\section{Surface-area average}
\label{sec:surface_area_average}

This analysis members computes areal-averages, areal-minimum and areal-maximum of two dimensional fields that are defined primarily at the surface. Let $R$ represent some subset to ocean surface cells and $f$ be some field defined on these ocean cells. Then the total area of region $R$ is given as

\begin{equation}
sumArea(R) = \sum_{i \in R} areaCell(i)
\end{equation}
where $i$ denotes any ocean surface cell and $areaCell(i)$ is the area of that cell. For any function $f$ defined at ocean surface cells we have

\begin{equation}
avg(f(R)) = \frac{\sum_{i \in R} f(i)*areaCell(i)}{sumArea(R)}
\end{equation}

In addition to computing averages, the analysis member also computes the minimum and maximum values of $f$ with region $R$ as

\begin{equation}
minval(f(R))=min(f(i)) \, \, \forall i \in R
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
maxval(f(R))=max(f(i)) \, \, \forall i \in R
\end{equation}

The region $R$ is defined using surfaceRegionMask that have values of 0 for cells not in region $R$ and a values of 1 for cells within region $R$. As a result, the analysis member operates on an arbitrary number regions.
