\chapter{Ocean Visualization}
\label{chap:ocean_visualization}

This chapter discusses visualization tools that are specific to the ocean core.  For instructions on visualization tools that may be used by all cores, such as Paraview, see Chapter \ref{chap:mpas_visualization}.

\section{Python}
\label{sec:ocean_python}

Python visualization scripts are provided with the tar files for the baroclinic channel and overflow test cases.  In order to use these scripts, the following python modules are required:
\begin{itemize}
\item matplotlib, see \url{http://matplotlib.org}
\item numpy, see \url{http://www.numpy.org}
\item pylab, see \url{www.scipy.org}
\item netCDF4, see \url{http://code.google.com/p/netcdf4-python}
\end{itemize}
A convenient way to install all these libraries at once is to purchase the Enthought Python Distribution (EPD), available at \url{https://www.enthought.com/products/epd}.  Many institutions have Python-EPD installed on their compute clusters.

Examples of output from python visualization scripts are shown in Figures \ref{fig:baroclinicChannelTemperature} and \ref{fig:overflow}.  Options for each script may be found using, e.g.
\begin{verbatim}
python visualize_overflow.py --help
\end{verbatim}
These scripts are easily customizable by the user.  Within the python script the specified variable is read from the NetCDF file using the commands
\begin{verbatim}
f = NetCDFFile(options.filename,'r')
field = f.variables[options.variable]
\end{verbatim}
The plot is created with the matplotlib command {\tt plt.imshow}, as described in the following tutorials:
\begin{itemize}
\item \url{http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.imshow}
\item \url{http://matplotlib.org/users/image_tutorial.html}
\end{itemize}
Text is then added with the commands {\tt xlabel}, {\tt ylabel}, {\tt title}; colorbar is added using {\tt plt.colorbar}; and the figure is saved to the local directory as a png file useing {\tt plt.savefig}.
