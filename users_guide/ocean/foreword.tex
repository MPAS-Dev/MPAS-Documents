\chapter*{Foreword}
\label{chap:foreword}

This User's Guide is for the Model for Prediction Across Scales-Ocean
(MPAS-Ocean), the ocean component of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model
(E3SM), developed by the U.S. Department of Energy. Herein we describe the
equations, namelist options, and variables for MPAS-Ocean. These settings apply
 to both the standalone ocean-only version of MPAS-Ocean, and E3SM version that
  is coupled to the atmosphere, sea ice, land ice, land and river components.

The MPAS-Ocean code for both standalone and coupled is housed in the repository
\url{https://github.com/E3SM-Project/E3SM}, within the directory
\texttt{components/mpas-ocean}. The standalone executable may be built within
that directory using the make command with the required libraries, as described
in Chapter 1 of this guide.

Documentation for the E3SM coupled climate model may be found on the
\href{https://docs.e3sm.org/E3SM/}{E3SM docs pages}, the
\href{https://acme-climate.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOC/overview?homepageId=1931641291}{E3SM Documentation webpage},
